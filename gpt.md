Add more synonyms: The current list of synonyms for each characteristic is limited. You can consider adding more synonyms to each characteristic to improve recognition accuracy.

Use WordNet more effectively: Currently, the code only extracts synonyms from the first sense of each word in WordNet. You can modify the code to extract synonyms from all senses of each word and rank them by relevance.

Use machine learning: You can train a machine learning model on a dataset of fruit characteristic descriptions to automatically extract characteristics from text. This can be more accurate and efficient than the current rule-based approach.

Use context: The current code does not consider the context in which the words appear. For example, the word "heavy" can refer to fruit yield or fruit size, depending on the context. You can modify the code to use contextual information to disambiguate word meanings.

Improve part-of-speech tagging: Part-of-speech tagging is not always accurate and can lead to misrecognition. You can experiment with different part-of-speech taggers or modify the current tagger to improve accuracy.

Use regular expressions: You can use regular expressions to extract characteristics that follow a specific pattern, such as "X cm diameter" or "X days to harvest". This can improve accuracy for specific characteristics.
